# Times Higher Education take home test - server

This directory contains the scaffolding for the THE take home test server. It contains config to setup [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io) so you can write things like arrow functions if you wish; a basic 'Hello World' Express server and a simple test using Jest.

You are not expected to use this scaffolding, it is provided to make the process of getting started easier.

Useful scripts:

- `yarn start` will start the server at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
- `yarn test` will run the tests (using Jest)
