# Times Higher Education take home test - client

This directory contains the scaffolding for the THE take home test client. It was was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and so contains all of the utilities and commands provided by CRA.

You are not expected to use this scaffolding, it is provided to make the process of getting started easier.

Useful scripts:

- `yarn start` will start the development app server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `yarn test` will run the tests (using Jest)
